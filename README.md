beos-bydpdict
=============

Application to use Young Digital Poland Collins' English-Polish/Polish-English dictionary in BeOS

This was outdated in 2004, dictionary engine got merged into BSAP.
This code was imported from my local CVS repository, so it contains whole history of changes.

I include here also a zip file with release just in case some BeOS file attributes were not preserved.
